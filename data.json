The ambience is lively as the chefs prepare nigiri for their customers. The selection includes fresh seafood from both local and international waters, including bluefin tuna and sea urchins from Japan. If you're in luck, the chef may serve seared kama-toro topped with premium uni. ",

Chef Kazuki Wan and his team offer two omakase menus, Yuki with 18 seasonal seafood selections and Shizuku with 22 seasonal seafood selections. In addition to the freshly sourced fish used for the nigiri courses such as kinmedai, buri, and akagai, non-nigiri courses are masterfully prepared, notably shirako chawanmushi and ankimoshu. Chef Kazuki's welcoming and cheery attitude creates a comfortable dining environment while maintaining professionalism. Shizuku only has seating for 8, so be sure to make reservations ahead of time.",

At the time of writing, the menu, which changes frequently, included notable snack pairs like a cockle soufflé paired with a beetroot flower with caviar and chicken skin and squid paired with millefeuilles topped with wagyu and foie. Additionally, the smoked tuna belly with pine nut emulsion was a star of the show. Chef Fran Agudo delivers a truly fulfilling gastronomic experience, from the quality of seasonal products to the meticulous presentation of each course.",

The almond croissant is the star of the show with its flaky texture, buttery and not-too-sweet taste, and authentic almond flavour. If you are ever near Vancouver, Thomas Haas is definitely worth the trip.",

        "review": "When an award-winning chef who has worked at Michelin 3-starred restaurants opens their own restaurant, it should be no surprise that the food and service are great. The menu includes delightful few-bite appetizers that are great for sharing in family-style and well-portioned entrees that are delicious, too. To top it off, Chef Michelle (who worked as a pastry chef at Per Se) finishes with well-crafted desserts that leave a strong final impression",

        "review": "Enjoy a good value lunch at Sushi Hil with their nigiri set that includes 8 nigiri and a roll for only 60 dollars. The set includes spot prawn and nodoguro, which you may or may not be able to find depending on the season. In addition, you can order from the a la carte menu to get another nodoguro nigiri or even foie gras nigiri. The environment is cozy and welcoming for new sushi guests.",

        "review": "This udon specialty restaurant does not take reservations, but there is no need to worry since the wait is probably not going to be very long. On the menu, you can choose from a few different options and each of them showcases the same key ingredient: udon noodles. The noodles are firm but springy and served with tempura, brisket, and other toppings. The bowl is not too salty and portion sizes are good for the price.",

        "review": "The restaurant door opens to a dimly lit path illuminated by lights on the floor which leads to a spotless dining room where the sushi chef awaits you. For both the lunch and dinner menus, the meal starts with an appetizer, followed by 10 pieces of nigiri, and ends with a delightfully creamy tamago with a light layer of burnt sugar on top. The selection may change depending on when you go, but if you are lucky, the appetizer might be shirako! The nigiri selection consists of classic high-quality fish including shima-aji, chutoro, otoro, and Hokkaido uni. For some of the white fish, the chef employs a technique in which the rice is lightly rolled in Japanese lime zest to add an additional element to the craft. Overall, the meal is of great value and quality, especially the lunch menu.",

        "review": "The selection at Sushi Kaji is pretty strong as it includes nodoguro, Japanese uni, and A5 wagyu. However, the dining experience misses the Edo-mae mark by not brushing soy sauce directly on the fish. Additionally, there are appetizers which do not contribute much to the meal. Surprisingly, the meal ended with a dessert that pleasantly reminded me of some destructed desserts from Spain.",
